# OpenSST Framework

Hello World!

The Open Source Security Tools Framework maps security controls recommended by well known security frameworks and best practices such as NIST, CIS and PCI to open source security tools.

Companies can achieve a certain degree of compliance and security maturity by making use of open source security tools.

The OpenSST aims to help entities to protect their data without having to spend money with proprietary tools.
